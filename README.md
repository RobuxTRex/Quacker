# Quacker
Discord's new best bot: covering little things like reactions to verification messages; to the big things like super moderation and so much more.
**Quacker aims to combine all the features of all of the most popular bots (... and also add some of our own!) to clean up your server's member list - meaning that you only need one bot on your server!**
